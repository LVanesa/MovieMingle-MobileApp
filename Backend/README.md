‚úî **Strengths:**  
- Uses **BCrypt hashing** for strong password protection.  
- Password validation enforces **regular expressions** to prevent weak passwords.  

‚ö° **Improvements:**  
- Set **BCrypt cost factor to 12+** to enhance brute-force resistance.  
- Implement a **password policy validator** enforcing stricter password complexity.  

---

### üìß Email Verification Tokens  
‚úî **Strengths:**  
- Email verification is required before account activation.  
- Tokens are **single-use** and **auto-deleted upon verification**.  

‚ö° **Improvements:**  
- **Schedule clean-up of expired tokens** to optimize database performance.  
- **Enforce token expiration** (e.g., **24 hours**) to limit prolonged access.  

---

### üîÑ Password Reset Mechanism Security  
‚úî **Strengths:**  
- Password reset is **token-based** and secured via email verification.  
- Reset tokens are **deleted immediately after use**, preventing reuse.  

‚ö° **Improvements:**  
- **Set token expiration** (e.g., **30 min**) to mitigate unauthorized use.  
- **Ensure only one active reset token per user** at any time.  

---

### üåê OAuth2 Authentication (Google)  
‚úî **Strengths:**  
- OAuth2 login is integrated, ensuring a seamless authentication process.  
- The application **extracts and verifies the user's email** as a unique identifier.  

‚ö† **Observations:**  
- Authentication **fails** if the OAuth2 provider **does not return an email**.  

‚ö° **Improvements:**  
- Add **fallback handling** for cases where an email attribute is missing.  

---

### üõë CSRF Protection  
‚úî **Strength:** **CSRF is enabled** for user authentication and account-related actions. 

---


### üöß Brute Force Protection  
‚ö† **Observations:**  
- No **rate limiting** for login attempts, making the system vulnerable to brute force attacks.  
- No **temporary account lockout mechanism** for repeated authentication failures.  

üîí **Recommendations:**  
- Implement **rate limiting** (e.g., **5 attempts per 10 sec**) and **temporary account lockout** after multiple failures.  
- Introduce a **captcha challenge** (e.g., Google reCAPTCHA) for flagged login attempts.  

---

### üîë Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
‚ö† **Observation:**  
- **No Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is currently implemented, meaning all authenticated users have the same access level.  

üîí **Recommendations:**  
- Introduce **RBAC** to restrict access to administrative or privileged functionalities.  
- Define **user roles** such as `USER`, `ADMIN`, and potentially `MODERATOR` to enforce **least privilege principles**.  
- Implement **Spring Security role-based authorization** to control access to specific endpoints.  

---
 

### üîê API Security  
‚úî **Strengths:**  
- API endpoints that modify user data require authentication.  

‚ö† **Observations:**  
- **All TMDb API endpoints are publicly accessible**, increasing exposure.  
- **No rate limiting on public API requests**, making them vulnerable to excessive usage.  

üîí **Recommendations:**  
- Apply **rate limiting** on public endpoints to prevent abuse.  
- Implement **IP-based throttling** for frequently requested APIs. 

---

### üö® Denial of Service (DoS) Protection  
‚úî **Strengths:**  
- Uses efficient API design to handle multiple requests.  

‚ö† **Observations:**  
- **No request rate limiting** on login and token generation endpoints.  
- **Excessive API calls** could degrade performance.  

üîí **Recommendations:**  
- Implement **IP-based request limiting** to prevent abusive behavior.  
- Introduce **caching mechanisms** for frequently requested responses.  
- Monitor **high request spikes** to detect potential DoS attacks.


---
### üîê SQL Injection Protection  
‚úî **Strengths:**  
- **Hibernate (JPA)** is used for database interactions, which **prevents SQL Injection** by utilizing **prepared statements** internally.  
- Queries are executed using **JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)**, ensuring safe query execution without direct SQL manipulation.  
- No **native queries** are used, eliminating risks from manual string concatenation in database queries.  

‚ö† **Potential Risks:**  
- While Hibernate prevents direct SQL Injection, **improper query construction** (e.g., dynamic query building with concatenation in JPQL) could still pose a risk.

---
### üîí HTTPS Enforcement  
‚ö† **Observations:**  
- The application currently runs on **localhost**, so HTTPS enforcement is not required in development stage.  

üîí **Recommendations for Production Deployment:**  
- Ensure **HTTPS is enforced** for all external requests when deploying to a live environment.  
---

## üöÄ CI/CD
We set up a **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub Actions** to streamline testing and maintain **code quality** across different environments. This pipeline automatically triggers on **every commit and pull request**, running **unit tests** to validate core functionalities.

### Key Features:
- **Automated backend unit testing** to ensure code reliability.
- **Prevents regressions** by verifying that new changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Locally hosted backend and database**, ensuring a stable and consistent development workflow.

This setup enhances the development process by providing **continuous validation** and maintaining a high level of **code integrity**.

---
### üõ† Development Environment  

#### üöÄ Backend:  
- Runs locally using *Spring Boot*, started via mvn spring-boot:run.  
- Connects to a *MySQL database* set up in application.properties for development and testing.  
- Unit tests are executed to verify functionality before new features are integrated.  

#### üé® Frontend:  
- Developed using *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript* to provide an intuitive user interface.
